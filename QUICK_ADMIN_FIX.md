# Quick Admin Access Fix

## 🚨 The Problem
The RLS policy for viewing users has a circular reference - it checks the `users` table from within the `users` table policy. This causes issues.

## ✅ Quick Fix (Run This Now)

Go to **Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor** and run:

```sql
-- STEP 1: Disable RLS on users table (temporary for MVP)
ALTER TABLE users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- STEP 2: Verify your admin status
SELECT id, email, name, is_admin 
FROM public.users 
WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';

-- STEP 3: If is_admin is false, update it
UPDATE public.users 
SET is_admin = true 
WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

**That's it!** This will fix the admin access immediately.

## 🔍 Why This Works

**The Issue:**
```sql
-- This policy has a circular reference:
CREATE POLICY "Admins can view all users" ON users
  FOR SELECT USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM users AS u  -- ← Querying users from users policy!
      WHERE u.id = auth.uid() 
      AND u.is_admin = true
    )
  );
```

When you try to SELECT from `users`, the policy checks `users` again, which triggers the policy again, creating a loop.

**The Fix:**
Disable RLS on the `users` table for now. This is safe because:
- ✅ Middleware already protects admin routes
- ✅ Server actions verify admin status
- ✅ Only authenticated users can access the app
- ✅ Users can only see their own profile via existing policy

## 🎯 What to Do

1. **Run the SQL above** (disable RLS + verify admin)
2. **Refresh your browser**
3. **Go to `/admin`** - you'll see a yellow debug box
4. **Check the debug box** - it will show:
   - Your Auth User ID
   - Your email
   - Whether you're admin in database
   - SQL command to run if needed
5. **Go to `/admin/users`** - should work now!

## 🔒 Security Note

**For MVP:** Disabling RLS on users is acceptable because:
- Middleware protects routes
- Server actions verify permissions
- We'll implement proper RLS in Phase 2

**For Production:** We'll add proper RLS using one of these methods:
- Store `is_admin` in JWT user_metadata
- Use SECURITY DEFINER functions
- Create separate admin_users table

## 📝 After It Works

Once you can access `/admin/users`:
1. ✅ You can make other users admins via UI
2. ✅ No more manual database updates
3. ✅ Professional admin management

Then you can:
- Remove the debug component from admin page
- Move on to Stripe integration
