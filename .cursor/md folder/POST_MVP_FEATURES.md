## üöÄ Priority 1: Enhanced Notifications

### PWA + Web Push Notifications
**Status:** Planned

- ‚úÖ No ongoing costs (free solution)
- ‚úÖ Can be installed as "app" on mobile devices
- ‚úÖ Offline support
- ‚úÖ Native-like user experience
- ‚úÖ Better than current browser notifications which only work when tab is open

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Create service worker (`public/sw.js`)
- [ ] Add Web App Manifest (`public/manifest.json`)
- [ ] Configure Next.js for PWA support (use `next-pwa` package)
- [ ] Create push subscription database table
- [ ] Build push subscription management API
- [ ] Update notification settings page to manage push subscriptions
- [ ] Integrate push notifications with queue notification system
- [ ] Add fallback to email if push fails

- [ ] Add app installation prompt/banner

**Technical Stack:**
- Web Push API
- Service Workers
- Web App Manifest
- Push Subscription Storage (Supabase)
- VAPID keys for authentication

**Database Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE push_subscriptions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  endpoint TEXT NOT NULL,
  p256dh TEXT NOT NULL,
  auth TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(user_id, endpoint)
);
```
