## üîß What We Deleted (src/app folder)

The `src/app` folder contained:
- **OLD auth context** (replaced by `/lib/auth-context.tsx`)
- **Basic membership page** (we'll build properly with Stripe)
- **Placeholder calendar page** (we'll build properly)
- **Duplicate About page**
- **Old navbar component**

None of these were being used by the app. The actual working app is all in `/app`.

## ‚úÖ Summary

**Good news:** The core application is solid and working well. Authentication, events, solo queue, and admin basics are all functional.

**What's missing:** Mainly the business-critical features:
- Group queue UI (database ready)
- Membership & payments (database ready)
- Admin user management
- Some polish features (calendar, SMS, etc.)

**Timeline:** Realistically 5 weeks to full feature completion, or 2 weeks to get core features (group queue + admin tools) done and launch with basic membership coming in Phase 2.
