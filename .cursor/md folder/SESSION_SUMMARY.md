## 🐛 Known Issues to Monitor

1. **Real-time subscription** - May need to enable in Supabase Dashboard
   - Go to Database → Replication
   - Enable for queue_entries and events tables
   - Check console for "SUBSCRIBED" status

2. **Admin RLS policies** - Need to run SQL script
   - `scripts/03-admin-rls-policies.sql`
   - Allows admins to create/edit/delete events

3. **Admin event detail page** - Still uses mock data
   - Needs Supabase integration
   - Similar to what we did for admin dashboard
   - Can defer to Week 2
