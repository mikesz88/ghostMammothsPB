## 💡 How It Works

### User Journey: Upgrading to Monthly

1. **User clicks "Upgrade"** → `/membership/checkout`
2. **Clicks "Continue to Payment"** → API creates Stripe session
3. **Redirected to Stripe** → User enters card details
4. **Payment succeeds** → Stripe redirects to `/membership/success`
5. **Webhook fires** → Updates database
6. **User has access** → Can join all events free

### User Journey: Joining Paid Event

**Free User:**
1. Views event → Sees "Pay $10 to join"
2. Clicks button → Payment flow (future implementation)
3. Pays → Can join queue

**Monthly Member:**
1. Views event → Sees "Join Queue"
2. Clicks button → Joins immediately (no payment)
3. Free access!

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Membership Pricing
Edit in `app/membership/page.tsx` and `app/settings/membership/page.tsx`:
```typescript
const monthlyPrice = 35; // Change this value
```

### Event Pricing
Set when creating events (admin dashboard):
- `price`: Amount in dollars (e.g., 10.00)
- `free_for_members`: true/false
- `requires_membership`: true/false

---

## 📊 Database Schema

- ✅ `membership_tiers` - Define plans (free, monthly)
- ✅ `user_memberships` - Track user subscriptions
- ✅ `payments` - Payment history
- ✅ `event_registrations` - Who joined which events

### Columns Added to Existing Tables
- ✅ `users.stripe_customer_id`
- ✅ `users.membership_status`
- ✅ `events.price`
- ✅ `events.free_for_members`
- ✅ `events.requires_membership`

---

## 🎯 What You Need to Do

1. **Create Stripe account** (if you haven't)
2. **Get API keys** from Stripe Dashboard
3. **Create Monthly product** in Stripe
4. **Set up webhook** endpoint
5. **Add keys to `.env.local`**
6. **Run database migration** (`scripts/02-membership-tables.sql`)
7. **Test with test card**

- [ ] Price ID copied
- [ ] Webhook endpoint added
- [ ] Webhook secret copied

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Test Mode vs Live Mode
- **Test Mode:** Use for development
  - Test cards work
  - No real charges
  - Separate data from live
- **Live Mode:** Use for production
  - Real cards only
  - Real charges
  - Separate API keys

### Webhook Testing Locally
Use Stripe CLI:
```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3001/api/webhooks/stripe
```

This forwards Stripe events to your local server for testing.

### Security
- Never commit `.env.local`
- Use test keys in development
- Use live keys only in production
- Rotate keys if compromised
