## ‚ö° Critical Path (Cannot Skip)

These items MUST be done for launch:
1. ‚úÖ Group Queue UI (Days 1-2)
2. ‚úÖ Stripe Integration (Days 3-4)
3. ‚úÖ Membership Pages (Days 5-6)
4. ‚úÖ Webhook Handler (Day 7)
5. ‚úÖ Event Access Control (Days 8-9)
6. ‚úÖ Testing (Days 17-18)
7. ‚úÖ Production Deployment (Days 19-20)

## üü° Important But Flexible

Can be simplified or deferred if time runs short:
- Manage Membership Page (can be basic)
- Admin Tools (force remove can wait, end event is nice-to-have)
- Google Calendar (can launch without)
- About Page (can use placeholder)

## üé® Nice-to-Have (Post-Launch)

Explicitly defer to Phase 2:
- SMS Notifications
- Shopify Integration
- Admin User Management UI
- Advanced Analytics
- Push Notifications

---

## üìä Daily Time Estimates

Assuming **8 hours/day** of focused development:

| Week | Days | Hours | Focus |
|------|------|-------|-------|
| Week 1 | 7 days | 56 hours | Group Queue + Stripe + Membership Setup |
| Week 2 | 7 days | 56 hours | Access Control + Admin Tools |
| Week 3 | 8 days | 64 hours | Polish + Testing + Launch |
| **Total** | **22 days** | **176 hours** | |

## üö® Risk Mitigation

### Potential Delays
1. **Stripe Integration Issues**
   - Mitigation: Start early, use Stripe docs/examples
   - Buffer: 1 extra day

2. **Real-time Updates Not Working**
   - Mitigation: Test early, simplify if needed
   - Fallback: Manual refresh button

3. **Payment Testing Takes Longer**
   - Mitigation: Use Stripe test mode extensively
   - Buffer: 1 extra day

4. **Mobile Issues**
   - Mitigation: Test early and often
   - Buffer: Already built-in with Tailwind

### Contingency Plan
If running behind schedule by Day 14:
- ‚úÖ Keep: Group Queue, Stripe, Basic Membership
- üü° Simplify: Admin tools (basic only)
- ‚ùå Cut: Google Calendar (post-launch)
- ‚ùå Cut: Fancy About page (basic text only)
